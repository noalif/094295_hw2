The task:

Improving the performance of a prepared machine learning model solely by operations on the data set itself, such as: 
correcting incorrect labeling, adding and creating additional examples for training, correct division for training and validation, and more.

The data set:
Images of handwritten Roman numerals, where the labeling of each image is the numeral itself.

The DATA folder contains both VAL and TRAIN so that the TRAIN folder contains all the examples and the VAL folder contains only one example from each class.

Limitation: Validation training folders will have a maximum of 10,000 samples.
